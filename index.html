                <h3>1. Two-tier-App Deployment</h3>
                <p>Successful deployment of our two-tier application, built on Flask and MySQL, to handle a whopping 10,000 concurrent users! Leveraging cutting-edge DevOps practices, we orchestrated this achievement with Docker and Kubernetes, culminating in deployment on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for fault tolerance and scalability.</p>
                <p>Containerization with Docker: Utilized Docker and Docker-compose for seamless encapsulation of application components, ensuring versioning and accessibility by pushing Docker images to DockerHub Repository.<br><br>
                Kubernetes Cluster Setup: Automated Kubernetes cluster setup with kubeadm, transitioning to AWS EKS for enhanced scalability and fault tolerance using eksctl for automated cluster creation.<br><br>
                Deployment with Kubernetes: Simplified deployment using Helm to package Kubernetes manifest files, ensuring consistency across environments and deploying the application on AWS EKS.<br><br>
                High Availability and Load Balancing: Configured multi-node Kubernetes cluster setup for high availability, implementing load balancing to optimize performance and reliability.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>2. Highly Available Web Application</h3>
                <p>Successfully designed and implemented a robust web application hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), ensuring high availability, scalability, and efficient management.</p>
                <p>VPC Architecture: Created a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with two public subnets in different availability zones.<br><br>
                EC2 Instances: Deployed instances in public subnets with auto-scaling groups for enhanced performance.<br><br>
                RDS Database: Utilized two RDS servers in private subnets across different availability zones for data management.<br><br>
                Load Balancer: Implemented an internet-facing load balancer to evenly distribute traffic to EC2 instances, optimizing performance and redundancy.<br><br>
                Monitoring Services: Integrated CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and SNS for proactive monitoring, logging, and notifications.<br><br>
                Web Application Features:<br><br>
                Developed a highly available web application using PHP, Apache, and MySQL.<br><br>
                Implemented a dynamic data retrieval system, showcasing sample data from an RDS database.<br><br>
                Ensured smooth operation with auto-scaling and load balancing, enhancing user experience.<br><br>
                Future Scope:<br><br>
                Expanding to additional AWS regions for global accessibility, implementing continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and exploring microservices architecture for scalability.</p>
